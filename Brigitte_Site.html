		<div id="one">About Me</div>
		<h2></h2>
				<p1>Hi everyone.  I have decided to expand my educational horizons and try to learn computer code.  I'm old but I'm smart.  But I am also slow. But they say you are never too old to learn something new.  So here I go.  I am the eldest of two children of an Air Force family. Growing up, we traveled around a lot but I suppose now I call Chicago my home.  My parents, brother and his family all live in Arizona now.  I have one niece and two nephews.  If you count my brother's two dogs, then I have four nephews.</p>
				<p2>I love to travel.  I have lived abroad for two extensive stints and in total I have been to 28 different countries. The world is such an interesting place.  If you don't believe me, get out and see for yourself. It's not as difficult or as expensive one may assume.</p>
				<p3>In college I studied anthropology.  It is the study of human beings and their environment.  With that in mind, I enjoy cultural events, diverse people and the excitement of living in a major metropolitan area. I consider Chicago the last great affordable city in America!</p>
		<div id="two">My Family</div>
		<h2></h2>
				<p1>My Mom loves to play cards and is very sociable. Each visit is peppered with extensive games of bid whist and shopping.  I have to mentally prepare myself for marathon sessions of both.  My Dad is an introvert and a recent retiree. He spends most of his time on the computer, at the gym and watching professional sports. With the amount of time he is on the computer you'd think he knows how to code...Reuben, my brother, is five years younger than me and works in behavioral health services. He enjoys spending time with his family and making music. He also knows a little about coding.  Talk about hidden talents...</p>
		<div id="three">Travel</div>
		<h2></h2>
				<p1>As I mentioned earlier, I've been all over the world.  One place I would like to return to for a deeper period of time is Asia, particularly Southeast Asia.  I just finished speaking to a friend who is moving to Sri Lanka.  I remember writing a book report on that country and the things that stood out in my mind were coconuts, tea, and tropical weather.  I like all of that! In that past, my favorite trips in Asia were:
					<ul>
						<li>Hong Kong</li>
						<li>Thailand</li>
						<li>India</li></ul></p1>
				<p2>In the late aughts (I just wanted to say that) I lived in South Africa and Kenya for four years.</p2>
				<p3>I have also visited the following European countries:
					<ul>
						<li>France</li>
						<li>Spain</li>
						<li>Italy</li>
						<li>Portugal</li></ul></p3>
		<div id="four">Fun</div>
		<h2></h2>
			<ol>

				<li>Tennis- I'm a natural singles player and  I've learned to like doubles.  But partner selection is key. Just like dating, if you don't hit if off, it will not end well. </li>
				<li>Theater - I support the Goodman Theater. I also enjoy going to alternative comedy shows. I'm currently investigating the "black hipster" scene of Chicago.  Its an bizarre world full of hilarious people</li>
				<li>Food- What can I say...I love to eat! My favorites are tacos, pad thai, sushi and curry noodle soup. Because of the diversity of this city, you get amazing food.</li></ol> 

		
		<h2>Well there you have it. I think I've shared a lot about me. I look forward to learning more about you!</h2>
